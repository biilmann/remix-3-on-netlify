# Remix 3 on Netlify (proof of concept)

https://remix-3-on.netlify.app/

This is a proof of concept demonstrating deployment of the early-stage [Remix 3 preview](https://github.com/remix-run/remix) deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) on [Netlify Functions](FOO).

I took the [bookstore demo](https://github.com/remix-run/remix/tree/main/demos/bookstore) from the Remix 3 repo and [made a few adjustments for Netlify](https://github.com/serhalp/remix-3-on-netlify/commits/main/).

## Try it out

To deploy this yourself:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npx netlify@latest init` to create a Netlify project
3. Run `npx netlify@latest deploy` to deploy it
